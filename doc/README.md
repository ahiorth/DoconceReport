# Structure of this folder
In this folder there is a `src` directory and `pub` directory. In the `src` directory you will find examples of doconce files and `make.sh` scripts to create `pdf`, `jupyter notebooks` and `html` formats from a single file. After running make.sh scripts, the compiled documents will be placed in the pub folder.
