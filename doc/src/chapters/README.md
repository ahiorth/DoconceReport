# Structure of this folder
The chapters are part of the [thesis](https://github.com/ahiorth/DoconceReport/tree/master/doc/src/thesis) project. However you can compile each of the chapters individually.

This folder contains a `make.sh` file, this file is not meant to be run separately. It is used by the `make.sh` in the chapter directories. Note that figures are stored in folders named `fig-<name_of_chapter_folder>` and source code is stored in `src-<name_of_chapter_folder>`. This is important, the doconce file should also be named `name_of_chapter.do.txt`.
